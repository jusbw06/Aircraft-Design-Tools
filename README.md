# Aircraft Preliminary Design Tools
(Senior Design)

- `Component Analysis Visualization Tool`: Allows one to estimate important vehicle properties such as CG and MAC locations thorugh representing different internal components (mass properties) as objects in Ocatave code. 
- `Operation Map`: Includes visualization of range and coverage of aircraft system based off of airports.
- `Payload & Liquid Weight Study`: Uses an iterative approach to the Breuget range equation to solve for estimates of necessary fuel and payload weights for aircraft.
