# Mass Properties Visualization Analysis Tool

Allows programmer to represent internal components in mass properties visually and observe changes in key vehicle properties, such as position of center of gravity or position of mean aerodynamic chord. Methods such as `addComponent` and `moveComponent` may be used to move components on the fly and recalculate vehicle properties.
